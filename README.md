# Rust UEFI Wrapper

Rust library that complies with parts of the [UEFI 2.9 specification](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_9_2021_03_18.pdf).

Currently, a work in progress that only implements parts of the specification that are needed by [SaucySalamander/bootloader](https://github.com/SaucySalamander/bootloader).
